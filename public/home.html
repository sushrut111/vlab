      <h5>Virtual Labs</h5>
Virtual Labs will provide to the students the result of an experiment by one of the following methods (or possibly a combination). Modeling the physical phenomenon by a set of equations and carrying out simulations to yield the result of the particular experiment. This can, at-the-best, provide an approximate version of the ‘real-world’ experiment. Providing measured data for virtual lab experiments corresponding to the data previously obtained by measurements on an actual system. Remotely triggering an experiment in an actual lab and providing the student the result of the experiment through the computer interface. This would entail carrying out the actual lab experiment remotely.

      <h5>Objectives</h5>
To provide remote-access to Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering. These Virtual Labs would cater to students at the undergraduate level, post graduate level as well as to research scholars.

To enthuse students to conduct experiments by the arousing their curiosity. This would help them in learning basic and advanced concepts through remote experimentation.

To provide a complete Learning Management System around the Virtual Labs where the students can avail the various tools for learning, including additional web-resources, video-lectures, animated demonstrations and self evaluation.

To share costly equipment and resources, which are otherwise available to limited number of users due to constraints on time and geographical distances.
